Computer networks : A group of computers connected with each
other through wires optical fibers so that they can interact and share 
resources and data

The aim of cn is to share resources among various devices

components :

NIC(National Interface card): It helps computer to communicate
with another device

The network interface card contains the hardware addresses, 
the data-link layer protocol use this address to identify
the system on the network so that it transfers the data to 
the correct destination.

Hub : Splitting of a connection to multiple devices 

When computer requests for information from a computer,
it sends the request to the Hub.
Hub distributes this request to all the interconnected computers. 

Switch : It is a device which connects the computers or other devices in a 
network.It enables transfer of mesages from one device to another.

Cable : It is a Trnasmission media

(twisted pair, coaxial , fibre optical cable)

Router : It is a device which connects computer to internet

Modem : It is a hard ware device which coverts the data to signals so that
they can be transmitted through cables.

Use of computer networks :

1.Resource sharing 
2.Data sharing Internet

Computer network types :

1.LAN : Local Area Network It is a type of nework 
where computers are connected 
within in a small range like a buliding or an office 

ex : college labs 

2.MAN : metrpolitan area network It is a group lans or devices are connected
 within a range of city or a state

ex : Cable tv,mobile connections

3.WAN : Wide Area nework : IT is a type of network overa large range ike a counntry 

ex : Internet


Transmission modes :

Simple : Communication is unidirectional 

Advantage : utilization of bandwidth of communication channel

ex : Keyboard or monitor.

Half duplex : Communication is bidirectional but not at the same time 

Advantage : utilization of bandwidth of communication channel

ex : Walkie - talkie.

Full duplex : Communication is bidirectional and can be done at same time(parallel)

Advantage : Parallel communication

ex : Telephone.

Network topologies :

Mesh topology : In this evry device is connected to remaining devices

NO.of lik - n(n-1)/2

Advantage : No data traffic issues because as there is dedicated link bw 
every two devices 

Star Topology : Every device is connected to a central dvice called hub 

Advantage : Less expensive

Bus topology : In this every device is connected to main cable
 
Advantage : Less cables required 

Ring topology : In this devices are connected in a cyclic fashion

Advantage : Easy to install

Hybrid topology : One or more combination of topologies is called hybrid topology

ISO OSI Model : It is a reference model designed how infomation from one system
is carried to other via newtork

It contains 7 layers and each one perform certain task

It divides a bigger task into smaller task
and each smaller task is assigned to each layer


1.Physical layer :

It transmitts bits from one device to the other.The bits recived sent to the upper layer 
i.e datalink layer

Functions : Bit rate transmissions
Bit synchoronization
Transmission mode

Hub,modem are examples of physical layer devices

2.Data link layer : Transfer of error free data frames

switch and bridge are data link layer devices

3.Network layer 

It works for transmission of data from one host to other hosts in different network

Functions : Packet routing
selection of shortest path to transmit the packet

4.Transport layer : It is responsible for sending the data completely
to see there is no duplication

5.Session Layer : It is used to create , maintain , terminate sessions
also maintains authentications

6.Presentation layer : It is used for translation of data into desired format.
Encryption/deecryption.Data compression

7.Application layer : It is top most layer of the model . It acts as interface to user 
like whats app messenger etc 

Tcp/ip (Transmission control protocol or internet control protocol):

It is more reliable than osi model

It provides only connection less services 

Layers : 4

1.Network acess layer  : It replaces Physical and data link layer in osi model

2.IP(Internet protocol ) : It replaces network layer in osi model

Services: Reponsible for devliary of packets for
source to destination using ip address

3.host to host layer : It is respponsible for end to
end communication 
it replaces transport layer in osi model

4.Apllication layers : It is the top most layer
which also replaces presentation and session layer
in osi model

services : Http,dns
